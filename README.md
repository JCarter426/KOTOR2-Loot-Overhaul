# KOTOR2-Loot-Overhaul
An effort to improve the random loot system in _Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II â€“ The Sith Lords_

Changes:
- Most random number rolls have been replaced with a new dice mechanic. The roll is still skewed based on the player's level, but it should now result in a wider variety of items.
- Each type of item has been given a custom script function. The specifics vary, tailored to each item type, but generally they adjust the probabilities to distribute items more logically (e.g. standard lightsabers are more common than double-bladed lightsabers) and replace items with higher-quality ones when they are available (e.g. the Watchman Blaster is replaced by the Elite Watchman Blaster if the player's level is high enough).
- Many robes were left out of random loot. It was not possible to roll any higher than 15, so it was nearly impossible to find most of the higher-quality robes anywhere in the game.
- When rolling a rare item, it was possible to roll *too* high and receive no item at all.
- Implant tier is now determined by level rather than the player's Constitution score. Unfortunately, the value available in game scripts is the *modified* score (including bonuses from items and powers) rather than the base score which is used to determine whether an implant can be equipped.
- Strength Gauntlets have been restored. Previously there was no 3rd glove variation, so random loot would give nothing in its place.
- The Vao Armband has been restored via random loot.
- The Heavy Mining Laser, Vibrocutter, and Guidon Beacon have been restored via random loot.
- The Baran Do Advisor Robes have been restored via random loot.
- It was only possible to receive 5 out of 11 of Mira's rockets through random loot.
- Droid utilities were missing from random loot. The item prefix was incorrect, so it would give no item when they were rolled.
- It was possible to collect multiple copies of what ought to be unique items (e.g. Exar Kun's Light Battle Suit and Circlet of Saresh). The random loot system will now keep track of which items you've found and won't give duplicates of unique items.
- It was not possible to receive Battle Stimulants through random loot.
- Random loot would only give Security Tunnelers and never the higher-quality Security Spike Tunnelers. There is now a chance of receiving them at higher levels.
- It is no longer possible to receive Clothing (a_robe_01) through random loot. When rolled, it is replaced with a robe item that has actual value.
- It is no longer possible to find blasters on Peragus through random loot, what with the ban on them. All weapons there have been replaced a selection of Peragus-specific items (Mining Laser, Advanced Mining Laser, and the restored Heavy Mining Laser, Vibrocutter, and Guidon Beacon, as well as other melee weapons).
- Peragus items have had their stats unified across all areas. They will also now stack in the inventory menu.
- It is no longer possible to find a Breath Mask on Peragus via random loot. There is one placed in the Peragus dormitories manually, so it didn't make sense with the design.
- It is no longer possible to find any stealth field generators on Peragus via random loot. There is one placed in the Peragus administration level manually, so it didn't make sense with the design.
- It is no longer possible to find robes on Peragus through random loot.
- On Peragus, the probability of receiving blaster or melee upgrades has been reduced, and armor overlays have been eliminated, to reflect the availability of items which can utilize these upgrades. In their place, the probability of equipment items has been increased and Peragus weapons have been added.
- Light armor has been removed from Jedi loot and replaced with power crystals.
- Components and Chemicals have been removed from random loot found late in the game, as there are few workbenches and lab stations available at that point. Stimulants are no longer excluded.
- The availability of certain items has been adjusted to remove some loopholes and present a more consistent experience. Some checks for player level used fixed values, and some checks used the name of the current area. Most of these have been replaced with checks for specific game milestones.
